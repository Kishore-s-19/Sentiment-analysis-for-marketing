## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7+**: The project is written in Python. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- *Jupyter Notebook*: You can use Jupyter Notebook to run the provided notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.

- *Pip*: Pip is a package manager for Python, and it's used to install project dependencies. You can check if it's installed by running pip --version in your terminal.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. *Clone the Repository*: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   shell
   git clone https://github.com/Kishore-s-19/Sentiment-analysis-for-marketing.git
   

2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*: Move into the project directory:

   shell
   cd NM-Sentiment-analysis-in-marketing
   

3. *Install Dependencies*: Use pip to install the required Python packages and libraries. Run the following command:

   shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing your dataset for sentiment analysis. To understand how the data was processed, you can refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook AI_Phase3.ipynb. This notebook covers handling missing values, text cleaning, and feature extraction.

## Training the Model

The sentiment analysis model was trained to classify text data into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The training process is explained in the Jupyter Notebook AI_Phase4.ipynb, which includes details about the model architecture and how it was trained. You can refer to this notebook for more insights.
